# finite-difference-calculator

My [website](http://williamjsdavis.pythonanywhere.com/).

In an attempt to learn the basics of making web applications, I decided to try and replicate Cameron Taylor's ["Finite Difference Coefficients Calculator"](http://web.media.mit.edu/~crtaylor/calculator.html). This is an algorithmic method for calculating the form of [higher order derivative approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference#Higher-order_differences) for use in numerically solving [ordinary and partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference).
